# React Course

## Requirements

- Yarn
- Node >=10.13

## Getting Started

In your terminal

- Install project locally : `git clone https://github.com/generous-folks/react-course.git`
- Install the dependencies `cd react-course && yarn`

Start the app :

- For the demo : `yarn start:demo`
- For an exercise : `yarn ex $exerciseNumber`
  > e.g. : `yarn ex 1`

## What you'll learn

You will create a simple shopping app step by step.
From the basic vanilla React example to a fully featured one with routing, global state management, lazy loading and so on.
It consists on a shared layout, a list of products, a product page and a shopping cart mostly.

We can't cover everything in this course, but we try to give a good overview of some common ways to build react apps.

### react

- Understanding of React principles
- Using Class and Functional components
- Managing state and props
- PropTypes checking
- Understanding lifecycles
- Context API
- Using hooks
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Architecture and code design

### react-router

- Basic Routing
- Param Matching
- Dynamic Routing and Code splitting

### styling

- CSS
- CSS-in-JS
- Material-UI library
- Styled-Components
- Global Theme usage

### redux (Bonus)

- Configuration and Architecture
- Basic global state management usage
- Middlewares
- Connected Router

## Workflow

The repository contains a bunch of folders like :

- **examples** : samples of everything you need to develop the app and to avoid spending time on stack overflow
- **theory** : some important concepts you should know to master this course
- **final-version** : a demo, or the actual final version of the app we're aiming to develop.
- **exercise-X** : All the exercises folders. We thought it was important to jump from an exercise to another having a corrected version of the previous exercise. It also makes more sense for group learning to always be on an equal state while going further.
